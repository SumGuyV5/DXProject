'DX Project!' was created to test and use my Direct X 8 Visual Basic Skill. Much of this code is similar to the code used at http://www.directx4vb.com/ as that is were I learned DX for VB. 
Note: It's very mess as I did it on the fly

Use the Number pad to move the Second Texture around.
Press 5 on the number pad to get a DX sound to play.
Press / on the key pad to play an MP3 and * to pause.
Press Q to quit.

Graphic Options is the only options that work.

This originally was going to be a game but I decide to practice my DX skill instead.

The Texture and Sound Are from http://www.directx4vb.com/ as well as the Wave sound file.

the MP3 is from my TV tuner from the simpsons.
